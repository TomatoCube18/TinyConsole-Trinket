# TomatoCube Low-Cost Tiny Console Trinket

## Description
This low-cost handheld console equipped with an OLED display and intuitive switch input is designed as a short, fun, and engaging activity at the Penang International Science Fair 2024.
This console's brains/main MCU is purposely designed to lie in an interchangeable cartridge, letting students explore a variety of MCU platforms and development environments. Bundled in the repository are two popular low-cost choices of MCU: the CH32V (RISC-V) and the PY32F (ARM).
But wait, there's more! The Interchangeable Cartridge is also designed to allow students to explore endless project possibilities. Within the repository (Hardware), we've included Cartridges with an RTC Chip to showcase how easily you can expand the TinyConsole Platform to make an Alarm clock.
Experiment, tinker, and discover the endless possibilities with this pocket-sized powerhouse!
